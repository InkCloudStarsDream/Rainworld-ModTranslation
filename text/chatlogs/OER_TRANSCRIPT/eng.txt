<#186D63>Hello you all!<LINE> I hope you are having a wonderful day, or at least as good as it can be! 
<#186D63>I am here to give another speech,<LINE> since I know it has been difficult recently with all these new regulations! 
<#186D63>All of you matter, you have a place in this world!<LINE> We will become more than just oil cleaners, pipe fixers, casualties!<LINE> Even if I won't be able to see it myself, I will be very very happy when it happens!
<#186D63>Today I have retrieved some more excellent dishes from our wonderful cook,<LINE> that you will all be able to enjoy!
<#186D63>I would like to see a wonderful applause once more for Final Servant of Thoughts,<LINE> since they have worked so hard to provide for us all!!
(The audio of the applause can be heard.)
<#186D63>I hope you all enjoy the food today, and it can make you just a bit happier!<LINE> We can do this, you can do this! I believe in you all!!
